Traffic Signs and Signal Recognition with Python

<h4> <b> Steps Followed: </b> </h4>

•	Traffic signs present in the image have been classified into different categories by building deep neural network model. </br>
•	The public dataset available at Kaggle has been used here for training and testing the model. </br>
•	The data has been stored in NumPy arrays and the CNN model has been used for classification of the images. </br>
•	For training the model the batch size of 64 has been used and after 15 epochs the accuracy was stable. </br>
•	The dataset has been saved using Keras model.save(). </br>
•	For testing a Tkinter GUI has been used. </br>
•	The GUI is build with a classify() and predict() function. </br>
